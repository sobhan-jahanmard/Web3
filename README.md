# Web3 Developer Roadmap

1. **Understanding Blockchain Fundamentals**

   - Blockchain Basics: What is a blockchain? How does it work?
   - Decentralization: Why is decentralization crucial in Web3?
   - Cryptocurrency: Learn the basics of how cryptocurrencies (like Bitcoin, Ethereum) work.
   - Public/Private Key Cryptography: How wallets and transactions are secured.
   - Consensus Mechanisms: Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), etc.

2. **Learn About Ethereum and Smart Contracts**

   - Ethereum Basics: Understanding Ethereum’s network and its features.
   - Smart Contracts: What they are and how they work.
   - Solidity: The programming language for writing smart contracts.
   - Gas Fees: How gas works on Ethereum and why it’s important.

3. **Dive Into Web3 JavaScript Libraries**

   - Web3.js or Ethers.js: These libraries allow your front-end to interact with Ethereum or other blockchains.
   - Wallet Integration: Learn how to connect MetaMask and other wallets to your dApp.
   - Transactions and Events: How to send transactions, read data, and listen to blockchain events.

4. **Frontend Frameworks for Web3 (dApps)**

   - Building dApps: How to build decentralized front-end applications that communicate with smart contracts.
   - State Management: Use state management libraries like Redux or React’s Context API with Web3.

5. **Understanding Decentralized Storage & IPFS**
   - IPFS: A decentralized file storage system.
   - Filecoin: A decentralized storage network.
6. **Exploring Layer 2 Scaling Solutions**

   - Layer 2 Solutions: Optimistic Rollups, zk-Rollups, etc.
   - Polygon, Arbitrum: Popular Layer 2 scaling solutions.

7. **Learn DeFi and NFT Standards**

   - DeFi: Decentralized Finance protocols, lending, borrowing, liquidity pools.
   - NFT Standards: ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards for non-fungible tokens.

8. **Security in Web3**

   - Smart Contract Audits: How to audit your contracts for vulnerabilities.
   - Common Vulnerabilities: Reentrancy attacks, overflow, underflow, etc.

9. **Testing and Deploying**

   - Unit Testing: Use frameworks like Truffle or Hardhat for testing smart contracts.
   - Deployment: Deploy smart contracts to testnets (Rinkeby, Ropsten) and mainnet.

10. **Contribute to Open Source & Network**

- Contribute to GitHub projects related to Web3.
- Join Web3 communities like Discord servers, Twitter, and Ethereum Foundation discussions.
